- The Red Hat OpenShift Web Console provides a graphical user interface to perform many administrative tasks for managing a cluster.
- The web console uses the Kubernetes APIs and OpenShift extension APIs to deliver a robust graphical experience.
- he web console provides ease of access and management for the complex tasks that cluster administration requires.
- The OpenShift web console is not related to the Kubernetes dashboard, but is a separate tool for managing OpenShift clusters
- From a terminal, you must first authenticate to the cluster via the CLI by using the oc login -u <USERNAME> -p <PASSWORD> <API_ENDPOINT>:<PORT> command:

Authnticate to the cluster using CLI
> oc login -u user -p password https://api.ocp4.example.com 

To retrievce web console URL:
>oc whoami --show-console 

perspectives
    - Administrators -> focuses on cluster configuration, deployments, and operations of the cluster and running workloads
    - Developers -> focus on creating and running applications

Key Concepts:
    Pods: The smallest unit of a Kubernetes-managed containerized application. A pod consists of one or more containers.

    Deployments: The operational unit that provides granular management of a running application.

    Projects: A Kubernetes namespace with additional annotations that provide multitenancy scoping for applications.

    Routes: Networking configuration to expose your applications and services to resources outside the cluster.

    Operators: Packaged Kubernetes applications that extend cluster functions.
