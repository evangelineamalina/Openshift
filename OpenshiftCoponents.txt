Red Hat OpenShift Components and Editions
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (RHOCP) adds enterprise-class functions to the Kubernetes container platform to deliver the wider business needs.
- Integrated developer workflow:
    - OpenShift integrates a built-in container registry, CI/CD pipelines, and S2I, a tool to build artifacts from source repositories to container images.
- Observability
    - OpenShift includes monitoring and logging services for both your applications and the cluster.
- Server management
    - Because OpenShift features build on Kubernetes extensibility, administrators can often operate these features by using their existing Kubernetes knowledge.
    - with managed services, the Red Hat Site Reliability Engineering teams update the clusters and remedy update issues (although you still participate in scheduling the updates)
    - On self-managed editions, you update the clusters and remedy update issues.
